## About the Project

Broodle is a mood tracking application designed to help users monitor and understand their emotions on a daily basis. In a world where mental health is becoming increasingly important, keeping track of oneâ€™s emotional well-being can provide valuable insights into behavior patterns, triggers, and overall mental health.

### The Problem

Many people experience fluctuating moods but lack the tools to properly monitor them over time. This can lead to difficulty identifying patterns that could be linked to mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, or stress. Existing mood tracking apps may be complex or unintuitive, deterring users from consistently logging their moods.

### The Solution

**Broodle** offers a simple, user-friendly interface to log and track daily moods. It provides an easy way to:

- Record your mood with a few clicks.
- Visualize your mood patterns over time.
- Identify trends that might affect mental well-being.
- Get insights into emotional triggers and potential remedies.

With Broodle, users are empowered to take control of their emotional health by regularly checking in and reflecting on their moods, making the tracking process easy and accessible.

## Features
